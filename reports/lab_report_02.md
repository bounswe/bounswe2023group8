# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Web Info Aggregator 
**Date**: 10.10.2023 

## Progress Summary
**This week** We did some revisions on our previous design artifacts. Removed some unnecessary requirements and clarified some of the ambiguous requirements. We applied these changes to our mock-ups and use case diagrams. We also refined some parts of our sequence and class diagrams. However, this work is not complete yet since we notice new possible changes to our design as we think on the practical applications of our design points.

Each member of the team decided on which part of the development they will work (web, back-end, mobile).

## Completed tasks that were not planned for the week

| Description  | Issue | Assignee | Due | PR |
| -------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- |
| Added lab reports in the repo under `reports` folder | [#197](../issues/197) | Bahadır | 09.10.2023 | [#198](../pull/198) |

## Planned vs. Actual
- We planned to decide on the structure of group organization by voting on the communicator and dividing team members by subgroups. Even if the organizational decisions can change later for practical reasons, organizational issues can said to be complete. 
- Besides that, the main problems that need to be solved in this week were revision and refactoring of project artifacts. We changed deficient parts of requirements and also took notes about parts that are not completely clear among the group. We arranged the class diagram, the sequence diagram, the use case diagram and the mockups according to mentioned changes in requirements. However, we realized that it is not possible for us to complete the revision of requirements without having another meeting with customer. @bakikucukcakiroglu held a question session with customers after Tuesday's lecture to clarify ambiguous parts. Then, we postponed completion of revision issues to the next week since all revisions are dependent of revision of requirements.
