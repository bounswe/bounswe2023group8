<!--StartFragment--><h1>Project Development Weekly Progress Report</h1>
<p><strong>Team Name:</strong> Web Info Aggregator</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 14.11.2023</p>
<h2>Progress Summary</h2>

**This week** **On the backend,**

We developed CRUD APIs for Interest Area and Post which are two main components of the project. Also developed all dependency classes of Interest Area and Post. They include nested interest area related classes, wiki related classes related classes. We also created wiki services and related classes to allow user label their posts and interest areas using wiki tags. Furthermore, Comment entity is implemented.

<p><strong>On the Web side</strong>,</p>
<p>We’ve implemented all Post views except the “Update Post view”. We now have a working geolocation modal that allows the user to select point on map and select one of the available addresses around that point.</p>
<p><strong>On the Mobile side</strong>,</p>
<p>We implemented explore page for unauthenticated visitors. We’ve also implemented post creation, post editing and post details views. Developed home screen for authenticated users.</p>
<p><strong>Next week,</strong></p>
<p>For front-end and mobile, we will implement Interest Area related pages to our project. Furthermore, the CRUD endpoints for Posts and Interest Areas which were implemented by our back-end team will be integrated.</p>
<p>For back-end,</p>

<!--StartFragment--><h2>Planned vs. Actual</h2>
<p> In the web side, geolocation views took more time than expected due to some problems. This caused some delays in our plans. We will need to work harder moving forward. On backend side everything was on plan. We neither did less nor more. We created CRUD APIs and models for Interest Areas and Posts which are two main components of the project. This week was an important milestone for backend side and we successfully accomplished our tasks. </p>

## Risks

Due to the lack of sufficient clarity in the descriptions of the issues, there is a potential difficulty for the project team members to comprehend (over time, etc.).

## UX design choices

- On the web side, we decided that it would be ugly to have an open map under every post when said posts have locations attached to them and it would definitely reduce UX because users would have to navigate around some big map in order to experience the rest of the app. That is why, we decided to make it so that the location is only written as a text on the post view and the user can simply click a button so that a modal will pop up and show the map in it.
- On the mobile side, on our mockups for ‘Create Post Page’, our input fields were composed of two parts; the first one was an explanatory short text (label) about our input, and next to that we had an input field with a placeholder. Since mobile phones are already small in size and design i mentioned caused non-aligned input fields, we decided to use only input fields. On that input field we are using the ‘Label’ property which explains what does input field stands for and when the user clicks that input field, the label shrinks.
- On the mobile side, instead of a side menu structure, we used a sophisticated bottom navigation bar with a clean tab bar design. We did not want to make an unnecessary side menu design that fills the screen by a ridiculous portion with not much to serve, instead, we made a simple and recognizable bottom navigation bar that users can easily use to navigate around our application.

## UX Elements we wish we had

- We had to remove the private chat function from our requirements because it would add a whole new complex structure to our project, for which we have no time or resources to spare. It could increase UX quality for the user because when users find others interested in similar areas as them, they could have shared some extra interests with each other, and invite others to their private interest areas even when they don’t know them in person.
