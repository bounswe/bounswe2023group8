# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Web Info Aggregator   
**Date:** 17.10.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week** We have revised most of our design, created a basic project plan to have some sort of understanding of our roadmap and prepared ourselves for the implementation of the project. We have decided on which technologies to use and initialized parts of our project. 

**Next week** We will be implementing our Authentication flow on mobile, web and backend sides.

## Risks
Initially we made plans for doing singular tasks each week until the end of the term. For example, if the mobile team is supposed to create Views for Authentication flow during a week, there will be -most probably- 3 views to create. This means that for a team with 5 members, 2 people will have no work to do since working on a single file with more than one person will complicate the process. We might need to replan our weekly tasks and complete them in parallel so that we can utilize this unused source of manpower.
