**On the Web side**,

We have implemented “Create Interest Area Page”, we have polished  post views and connected them with geolocation flows. 

**On the Mobile side**, 

We have created interest area pages for both visitor and member users. Also, we have created creating and editing interest area page. Then, we have made interest areas CRUD endpoints integration.

**Next week;**

O**n the Backend,**

We will implement all the APIs needed for requirements we promised to meet at this milestone. They include InterestAreaPage API, InterestAreaSearch API, Home Page API and also Post and Comment API. 

****************************On the Web side,****************************

We will connect all the current components with the previously missing endpoints. Polish what we have and prepare missing components for the Customer Milestone 2

****************On the Mobile Side,****************

We will update mockups according our new needs because as we implemented mockups we realize some missing parts. Also, according to new mockups we will update our designs on app. We will connect post, profile and home pages with their endpoints.

## Planned vs. Actual

On the Web side, we have missing components that were supposed to be completed earlier but were not due to the inexperience of the team. 

On the backend side ‘**Backend - Add Access Level Management’** is not completed for this week. ‘**Backend - Create Comment Model and CRUD APIs’** and ‘**Backend - Create Post CRUD APIs’** are missing from the previous week. Other issues of backend have been completed. Furthermore, follow/unfollow apis for user and interest area are completed. 

On the mobile side, we have planned to make posts CRUD endpoints integration, but we couldn’t because the endpoint was not ready.

## Your plans for the next week

## Milestone Plans

During the customer milestone, we will demonstrate our application through the use of our carefully crafted user scenarios. We will either use the same scenario for both mobile and web or create one separate scenario for each. More than that could take too much time during the demonstration. 

Leading up to the Milestone, we plan to complete and polish the functionalities that we will demonstrate with our scenarios. Also, we will complete most of the other functionalities within the close proximity of the scenarios because the customer might ask what happens if the user deviates from the scenarios we set for ourselves. We will hopefully have most of our core functionalities ready by then.

We will not be able to show anything regarding **annotations** yet because annotations are supposed to be built on our other components. Our annotations will be using pop up or pop over mechanisms to be rendered on the screen. Instead of directly highlighting the text on regular post view, we will have a list of annotations appear on the pop up and the users will be able to select the annotation they want to see, which will lead to the post being highlighted according to that specific annotation. 

## How do we plan to test our app?

Web UI will be tested using the UI testing automation tool of ‘Trailblu’ which is a startup from our department .

On the mobile side, we will do manual testing by real devices.
